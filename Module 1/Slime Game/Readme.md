# Overview

This is a cute and simple slime game. I mainly just made this to practice using a physics engine to create a slighty fustrating way to move around levels as a base for a possible rage game in the future. 

to play the game you simply press on the left and right arrow keys to jump then hit them again to move left or right while in the air.

# Development Environment

I used a combo of VS code as well as the python arcade library which did most of the physics for me as well as came with some assets I could use to get started quickly.
