# Overview

A rough idea for the a site that I had a while back that I wanted to use so I could practice using Django. It has basic functionality as some interactions such as an acordiaon type movement in some of the sections and links but, isn't fully fledged. 

In order to test it I go to vs code and run the python django debug and it automatically runs the code I need to start it.

3 Web Pages

The pages are glued together through the url and view function of Djang to bring all of the pages and the images together. The home page is basic with just a few descriptor paragraphs and a header image and the 2nd and thrid pages have both open paragraphs as well as acordion sections that open and close as the person clicks them. Also each link of the page changes color when they are hovered over. 

# Development Environment

I used VS code with the plugins for Djang set in the enviroment to run the program. 

I used Djang, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
