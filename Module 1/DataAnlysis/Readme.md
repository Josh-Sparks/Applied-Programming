# Overview

I wanted to try and make a program that analyzes some data and one of the biggest data sets I know of is voters so I compiled some statistics on the age of voters to figure out what I could learn about whether or not voting has been in decline and who the voted the most and who voted the least.

# Data Analysis Results

I found that 
1 voting had declined among groups as time has gone by
2 the people who voted the least were 21-24 years olda
3 the poeple who voted the most were 76-79 year olds
# Development Environment

I found the voter statistics for idaho online which split up the voters in terms of years. I then used Pandas to compare them and find how many of these groups voted compare to those who didn't as well as got an average of all of them.

# Future Work

* Make it so you can specify which age groups you wish to work with. 
* Draw more statistics
* Allow users to specify which statistics they want to draw upon
