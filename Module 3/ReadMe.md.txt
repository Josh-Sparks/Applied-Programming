# Overview

I wanted to play around with class creation as well as animating thing in Java so I created this small little project where you can rotate a cannon using the left and right or D and A keys and can increase the power with the up and down or W and S keys and fire a small cannon ball with space. It keeps track of where the last cannon ball was fired and is made simply to calculate basic physics. 

I've been a bity rusty on class creation and animation so I went and did this really just to practice and refresh myself on how all of this works.

# Development Environment

I used Eclipse ED, it is a software that allows me to create and edit java code as well as gives access to Java lybraryies and I mainly used Java.awt and Java.swing for this project as both of these specifically add graphics which I can draw over and implement in my program.

# Future Work

- The starting Position of the shot needs to match the rotation of the cannon.
- I would add numbers to tell you where the shot landed
- add a slider to change the height of the cannon.
